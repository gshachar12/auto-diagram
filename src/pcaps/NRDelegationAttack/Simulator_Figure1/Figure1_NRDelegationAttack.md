*Figure 1: “Delegation server” variant of the NRDelegationAttack flow overview, focused on the resolver requests and responses.*


## Phases of the NRDelegationAttack

### Phase I — Large Referral Response (LRR) Received

1. Attacker’s client queries the victim resolver about `attack0.home.lan`.
2. Victim resolver queries `home.lan`.
3. `home.lan` responds with a **Large Referral Response (LRR)** containing many NS records.

### Phase II — Resolver Processes the LRR

1. For each of the **n NS names** from the LRR, the resolver looks up each of them to see if any one of them is already cached.
2. The resolver performs **2n cache lookups** (for each NS name and corresponding A/AAAA).
3. Begins resolving up to `k` referral-limit NS names (e.g., `k=5` in BIND9).
4. Sets `No_Fetch` flag to avoid excessive NS processing.
5. Queries the first batch of referral-limit NS names.

### Phase III — Delegation Loop and Restart

1. Each of the `k` NS names leads to a delegation to an **authoritative server** that is **non-responsive**.
2. Resolver triggers a **restart event**, clears `No_Fetch`, and starts resolving the next `k` names.
3. This loop continues until either:
   - Restart limit (e.g., 100 in BIND9) is reached, or
   - A timeout occurs.
4. Eventually, the resolver returns a **FAIL** response to the client.
